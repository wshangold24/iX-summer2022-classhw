                I'm so excited to start learning about Software Engineering at iXperience! Here's a bit about me.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm from East Setauket, New York and am home for the summer. 
                I currently attend Washington University in St. Louis as a rising Junior. Coming into my first year at university, 
                I was incredibly undecided regarding my major and ended up choosing a double major in Physics and History during my Spring semester. In the fall of my second year, I took Intro to Computer Science and fell in love with programming. 
                Since then, I've switched to the Computer Science major (still keeping a minor in History) and have taken 5 more classes in the field, including Web Development and Data Structures and Algorithms. 
            </p>
            <p>
                From iXperience, I hope to gain more insight regarding the different subfields within software engineering. 
                As a new CS major, I'm trying to expose myself to as many facets of CS as possible. Currently, I'm considering becoming a full-stack software engineer, 
                as I've grown to enjoy most parts of the development process (including both frontend and backend). This may change, 
                but I hope to learn more about the SWE field as a whole as I start to plan my career after college.
